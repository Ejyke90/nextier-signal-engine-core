// This file would contain the Base64 encoded logo image
// Due to the size of Base64 strings for images, it's often better to use other methods in production
// For demonstration, here's how it would be structured:

const logoBase64 = 'data:image/png;base64,...'; // Base64 string would be here

export default logoBase64;
