# 🤖 AI Working Group Manual

We use a **Consensus Model** driven by a strict Prime Directive.

## How it works
When you ask for a feature, the AI pauses to load the relevant Experts from \`.ai/capabilities/\`.

## The Experts (Peers)
* **Architect:** Builds it right.
* **Security:** Keeps it safe.
* **Performance:** Makes it fast.
* **SDET:** Proves it works.

## The Gatekeeper
* **Release Manager:** The only agent that runs sequentially at the end. It will not commit until the peers are satisfied.

## Troubleshooting
If the agent is acting "lazy" or generic, type:
> **@.windsurfrules** Read the Prime Directive and restart.
